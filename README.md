# GroceryLine

I came across a [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9fmr1TpKHE) by [@WebDevCody](https://www.youtube.com/@WebDevCody/featured), and thought it sounded like a fun thing to do to warm up before some bigger project. 

The premise is simple. This simulates a number of lines, like those at a grocery store.
- Customers, represented as circles, have a number of items to be checked out.
- They get into lines to check out.
- Each line "scans" an item at a rate of one every half second.
- Only the customer at the front of the line can scan items.

I decided to make it possible to alter some of the settings so it's at least interactive.
